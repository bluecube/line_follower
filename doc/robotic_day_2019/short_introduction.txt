The name Procrastinator 9000 comes from the fact that the robot was designed and mostly built after Robotic Day in 2014 and then spent the next four years in a drawer dreaming its sad, cold, untested and software-less dreams.

The design is an attempt to make a line follower with minimum effort on the hardware side and maximum versatility on the software side.

The robot body consists of a 8cm x 10cm double sided PCB, two geared N20 DC motors with Pololu wheels and a few 3D printed bits. The most important electronic components are Teensy 3.2 development board for computing power and line sensor inspired by Ondřej Staněk's PocketBot, as a bonus the robot also carries an IR range sensor and MPU 6050 breakout board (accelerometer and gyro).

Now he is ready to conquer the world...

All software and hardware is available on github: https://github.com/bluecube/line_follower
