LF2
- Design goal: simple hardware, maximum flexibility
- In development for several years now, first time close to being finished
- Preceeded by Procrastinator 9000
  - Qualified, but didn't race in Robotic Day 2019
  - Second system effect is real!

Mechanical
- PCB base
- 3D printed PETG parts
- Opening top hatch doubles as a stop button
- Alluminium armor/plow, mostly decorative
- N20 gear motors with encoders
- 40mm wheels

Electronics and sensors
- ESP32
- Custom line sensor
  - Alternating red LEDs and phototransistors, 10 measured points
- A4950 H-bridges
- MPU6050 six axis IMU
- Laser distance sensor

Software
- PlatformIO for toolchain and dependency management
- C++17
- Using ESP-IDF, not Arduino
- Hardware abstraction layer
  - Hides ESP-IDF access, robot hardware represented as a singleton class
- Hierarchical state machine for programming behaviors
