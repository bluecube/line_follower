LF2 is a robot designed with an emphasis on simple hardware construction and maximum flexibility.
Its development has been going on for several years, and it usually makes the most progress
the night before the (usually unsuccessful) registration for Robotic Day.
The LF2 robot was preceded by the Procrastinator 9000 robot designed with a similar approach.
(Not only) because of this, LF2 suffers from a strong second system effect ("it doesn't matter that it will be more work for me, I'd rather do it P R O P E R L Y").

The basis of the structure is a printed circuit board, on which parts 3D printed out of PETG and an aluminum armor/plow blade (more of a design element than a functional element) are screwed.
The movement of the robot is taken care of by two N20 gear motors with quadrature encoders and 40mm Pololu wheels.
To track the line, the robot uses a sensor composed of six red LEDs and five phototransistors, together this allows measuring the reflectivity of the surface at ten positions (between pairs of LEDs and phototransistors).
The module with ESP32 provides a completely unnecessary amount of computing power and there is a six axis IMU MPU6050 and a laser distance sensor in reserve.

The robot software is written using C++17 and uses the ESP-IDF library to access peripherals (no Arduino!).
The software defines a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that wraps all ESP-IDF accesses, pin numbers, and the like into a single class for easier testing and eventual simulation.
The behavior of the robot during the competition is controlled by a simple state machine.
Platformio environment (https://platformio.org) is used to manage the compiler, dependencies and other components.

All 3D models, code and documentation for the LF2 bot is available on GitHub at https://github.com/bluecube/line_follower.
