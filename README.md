Line follower
=============

This is a robot I made to tinker with and to compete in [Robotic Day 2019](https://roboticday.org/) (Actually the original goal was Robotic Day 2016, but stuff got delayed :) )

The design is an attempt to make a line follower with minimum effort on the hardware side and maximum versatility on the software side.

The robot body consists of a 8cm x 10cm double sided PCB, two geared N20 DC motors with Pololu wheels and a few 3D printed bits.
The most important electronic components are Teensy 3.2 development board for computing power and line sensor inspired by Ondřej Staněk's PocketBot, as a bonus the robot also carries an IR range sensor and MPU 6050 breakout board (accelerometer and gyro).

This repository should contain everything necessary to build and run the robot in the competition.
Let me know if you decide to build it!
